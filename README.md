# Pixar and Dropbox 404 Page Clones

This project involves cloning the 404 error pages of Pixar and Dropbox using HTML. It was created as a part of my coding bootcamp to practice HTML markup and recreate the design and layout of these popular websites error pages.

## Pixar 404 Page

The Pixar 404 page clone replicates the visually appealing and whimsical design found on Pixar's error page. It aims to capture the essence of Pixar's brand and create an engaging user experience for visitors who encounter a broken link or unavailable page.

## Dropbox 404 Page

The Dropbox 404 page clone recreates the clean and minimalist design of Dropbox's error page. It focuses on simplicity and effective error messaging to provide users with a clear indication that the requested page cannot be found.
